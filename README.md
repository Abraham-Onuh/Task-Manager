# Task-Manager
A simple menu-based application created to aid a person in effectively planning and executing  his/her tasks.
It is able to carry out functions such as:
addition of a new task to a database (a text file is used as the database),
searching for a task based on a specific feature & receiving feedback on the status of the task (i.e. completed or uncompleted),
viewing all tasks at once & also receiving feedback on the status of the task,
and finally deleting tasks that have been completed and are not needed any longer.
